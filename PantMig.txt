Solution description:
PantMig is a web- and mobileapp (cross platform), where users can Create a tasks: submitting a post about Pant (can deposit) up for donation.
The Pant can be reserved by a user, who will pick up the cans and get the Pant money.  

Use Case, Peter and Sara: 
Peter has a trashbag of Pant (50 cans, 1kr. deposit/can). Peter creates a poss:
"Big bag of Pant" --> Amount: "50 kr.", Location: "Nyresvej 2, Storbyen", PicupTime: 17:00-19:00
+ Picture of Pant for donation

The post is created, pinned on a live Map of Active Entries of Pant. 

Sara is online and lives near Peter. Sara sees the new Entry, and reserve the tasks and donation. 

Peter accepts Sara's request to Reserve the Pant. 
The Entry is now "removed" from the Map, and other users can not see it. 

When Sara picks up the Pant, Peter validates it in PantMig. 
When Sara has panted the Pant, and received the Receipt from the Pant Machine, she ends the task by putting in the actual Pant Money Received and available for payout.
The tasks is closed completely, put in a Historick stack of Peter (Total Donated Pant) and Sara (Total Received Pant) 






A Panter (like Sara in Use Case, Peter and Sara) cannot have more than three active tasks - all tasks has to be completed before a new can be taken. 
-> All tasks MUST be ended with Entry of Pant Money Received.

No Panter can take tasks after reaching 350 DKKR Pant Money Received. Unless there is a x number of Panters per km^2 .
